Website: <a href="https://f-url.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">f-url.herokuapp.com</a>

#### This is a <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/mcmo" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp.com</a> project which uses full-stack JavaScript to accomplish the following objectives.

1.   I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.
2.   If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.
3.   When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.
